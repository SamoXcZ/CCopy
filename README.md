# CCopy

CCopy is a modern clipboard manager for iOS that allows you to effortlessly save and organize your clipboard history. With CCopy, you can easily track everything you copy, and choose to keep important entries permanently.

## Features

- **Clipboard History**: Automatically saves everything you copy for easy access to previous entries.
- **Auto-Delete**: Cleans up entries after 7 days, ensuring your clipboard remains organized.
- **Permanent Save Option**: With a simple tap, keep any clipboard entry forever.
- **Sleek User Interface**: Designed with a modern aesthetic for intuitive navigation.


## Installation

To get started with CCopy, download the latest release from the [Releases](https://github.com/SamoXcZ/CCopy/releases/tag/1.0) page.

# ISSUES
• Sideloady has an random error with the app not being recognised or whatever. Use ALT store instead or any other iPA Signer. (It may be fixed soon idk).

## Usage

1. Copy any text or item you want to save to your clipboard.
2. Open CCopy to view your clipboard history.
3. Tap any entry to save it permanently or manage your history.
4. Enjoy a streamlined clipboard experience!

# Reminder
• Please enable this in-app settings to "allow", if you want to remove that boring alert everytime the app asks to auto-paste.
